# July 25th: Getting to work after I got an Idea!

I was drooling at Nixie tube clocks but those arent available in India ;-; Then I got an idea, why not make it out of LEDs. Turns out, it wasnt so original, people have attempted it [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/wgo8go/made_another_bigger_led_filament_tube_clock/). But I wasnt able to find any intructions, BOM, or schematic. So I am trying to create my own LED clock.

I would be using LED filaments (Adafruit nooodles kind) to create 7 segment displays which would be mounted vertically onto a PCB. I would run it using a ESP 32.
